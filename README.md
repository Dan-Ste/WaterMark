# Watermark

> Watermark is a application for generation picture with watermark, obviously^^.
> This is third homework from LoftSchool with requirement team work.

### Team

* [Daniel Steshenko] - team lead, JS, git, refactoring, code review.
* [Maksim Popov] - HTML, CSS, JS.
* [Mihail Izmaylov]- PHP, JS.
* [Aleksandr Lyubakov] - JS, HTML.
* [Valery Litvinchuk] - JS, HTML

### Development and use
If you want to local install our app, you need make following commands in terminal:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Dan-Ste/WaterMark.git watermark
$ cd watermark
$ npm i
$ bower i
$ cd php
$ php composer.phar update
$ gulp
```

Then you need local server like [XAMPP] or [MAMP]. Move php and all files and folders in dist folder into host folder of your server. Sorry for that, we change it soon.

Also this app hosts on http://watermark.p-max-p.ru
